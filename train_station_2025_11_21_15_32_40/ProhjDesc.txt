This sketch is a portrayl if my train station cloest to my home that I use daily, Lefferts Blvd A train station.
I feel my sketch shows a good base of what buildings and objects are around the area. the color choice for each object also helps each area stand out.
A struggle when creating this sketch is that I am not framilliar with coding for curved objectes. Any curved object was made straight as it was what I was able to make.
I felt proud of my work as the shilloutete is recognizable. 
As a final reflection I think this work is meaningfull as it is an area I stayed by and used for majority of my life.
